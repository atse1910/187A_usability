                      This website, shows the all the sub-categories under the higher-level menu (figure1). It seems little messy, yet it is efficient. For example, when we tried to go to page that contains ‘Study Abroad,’ we only needed one single click to ‘Current Student’ form ‘Home.’ Since the site-map like ‘Current Student’ shows that ‘Study Abroad’ is located under the ‘Academic Programs.’ It saves users time a lot, and reduces useless clicking to check other menus if they have the goal contents. We found that in order to go to ‘Study Abroad’ page on UCSD website we needed to follow four pathways ‘Current,’ ‘Student Life,’ ‘International,’ and finally ‘Program Abroad.’ Plus, we experienced that we clicked other menus such as ‘Academics’ and ‘Department & Programs’ to check it they contain the contents.
                       </p>

                       Side bar is one of the most powerful option that makes using website more efficient. However, we found the side menu of this web site has a big problem. Firstly we need to think about the main function of the side in most websites. The side bar menu is the one that have the longest appearing time in most website. When users surf website from one page to another, they firstly check the side bar, because that is always there no matter which page they are in. 
						<br>
						<br>
						In this website they put the very basic menus such as ‘Prospective Students,’ ‘Current Students,’ ‘Alumni,’ ‘Visitors,’ so on. However, from the users point of view, only one of the menus is fit with them. For example, for the current students, ‘perspective students’ menus or ‘visitors’ menus are just useless information most of time. In other word, after a user click and entered current student menu, the user no longer needs to have the side bar menu. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Thus, appearing such menus on the side for whole time on the website is wasting the place that can be used much more effectively. We recommend having a drop down menu of the Current page.
